# Write a function called operate that receives an operator ("+", "-", "*" or "/") as Ð° first argument and
# multiple numbers (integers) as additional arguments (*args).
# The function should return the result of the operator applied to all the numbers.
# For more clarification, see the examples below.
# Submit only your function in the Judge system.
# Note: Be careful when you have if multiplication and division:
#
# # Input
#  print(operate("+", 1, 2, 3))
#
# # Output
#   6
#
# Input:
#   print(operate("*", 3, 4))
# Output:
#   12
